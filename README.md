# GS1 barcode check digit calculator
Implementation of the algorithm to calculate the check-digit of a GS1 barcodes

## GS1 EAN standard coding
The GS1 EAN standard coding requires that every well-formed code ends with a check-digit that will be used by barcode readers to interpret the code properly. The check-digit is a number between zero and nine and it is calculated according to the other digits in the code. The calculation algorithm is shown [here](https://www.gs1.org/services/how-calculate-check-digit-manually).

This repository contains the algorithms needed to calculate the check-digit of a GS1 barcode using different languages.
